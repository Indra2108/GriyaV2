## My Favorite Websites

- [jamesg.blog](https://jamesg.blog/) ~ James is a great Technical Writer, and recently he released an amazing book called [Software Technical Writing: A Guidebook](https://jamesg.blog/2024/01/03/software-technical-writing/), this book will guide you to become a great Technical Writer like him. He tries hard to avoid using language that is difficult to understand or difficult to digest. I barely even looked at the dictionary when reading this book! you should read it too!

- [iamtk.co](https://www.iamtk.co/) ~ TK or TeeKay is a Software Engineer, Writer, and Researcher. The only reason why I put him on the list is that I love the way he writes and explains some hard concepts to become easy. one of my favorite TeeKay articles is when he explains about [Functional Programming concept](https://www.iamtk.co/an-introduction-to-the-basic-principles-of-functional-programming).

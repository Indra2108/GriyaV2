## Why did I shift from Hugo to 11ty (Eleventy) ?

- After shifting from Hugo, I found that 11ty is extremely easy and costumizable. and the Documentation is pretty easy to understand as well.
- Adding markdown plugin in 11ty is simple.
- I finally can embed my webapp (bookmarks) to my static site with 11ty in ease.
- Contents management in 11ty is pretty convenient.
